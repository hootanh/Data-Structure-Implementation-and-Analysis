// The other two vectors are initially empty and are the same size as friends.
// Your assignment is to fill them with the relevant values;  when you return, for all i:
//		pathLengths[i] will be the length of the shortest path from start to i in the graph described by "friends"
//		numShortestPaths[i] will be the number of shortest paths from start to i in the graph so described.
//				Note that a path, in this context, may not repeat a vertex (person).
// You are encouraged to read proj2tests.cpp in the gtest folder and attempt the three graph cases by hand.
